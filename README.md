# Qiran-summer-school-Lab-tasks
QNickel (August 05 – August 17) held a hands-on educational summer school workshop in Qiran that focused on basic and intermediate levels in quantum computing and programming.
The mentors guided us from the basics of quantum computing to an advanced level with Qiskit, a Python library for quantum computing.
The topics covered during the workshop are:
1. Qiskit, Classical gates, Phase kickback
2. Algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
3. Vazirani Algorithm, Simon’s Algorithm
4. Introduction to Cirq, Grover Algorithm revisited
5. Max-Cut Problem and Bipartite Graphs
6. Adders and Numbers Checking, Grover algorithm for Max-Cut Problem
